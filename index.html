    <p class="byline"><strong>STORY BY</strong> John Ferrara, Michelle Sheen, Allen Zhang & Kiara Hill</p>
    <p>
      Estella, a short-legged Schnauzer-mix with wiry gray fur, was six years old when Kate Goldberg took her in to live a peaceful life in San Francisco, occasionally snacking on too many bacon bits.  
    </p>
    <p>
        Goldberg, now retired, calls Mission Dolores Park her “backyard” and finds community with fellow dog owners everywhere she goes. 
    </p>
    <p>
        “There’s a whole subculture, and on our block, we call it ‘dog alley,’” Goldberg said. 
    </p>
    <p>
        San Francisco, known for its thriving tech start-up scene, is also recognized by how it welcomes its four-legged friends as the city ranks as one of the top 10 most dog-friendly cities in the U.S., according to a 2022 study by SmartAsset. 
    </p>
    <p>
        A quick walk to Mission Dolores Park or Alamo Square Park will make that clear enough, with owners walking dogs who are often dressed in fluffy turtleneck sweaters or wind-proof parkas. 
    </p>
    <p>
        QUOTE FROM A DOG OWNER?
    </p>
    <p>
        NUT GRAF: However, many dogs in the city don’t get to enjoy the same luxuries. Live release rates, or the rate at which animals are released from shelters, have been on a steady decline since YEAR, according to statistics released by San Francisco Animal Care & Control (SF ACC). 
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2023, SF ACC recorded the euthanization of 269 dogs — that’s almost 100 more dogs that failed to find homes compared to the previous year. 
    </p>
    <p>
        One reason for this is that many pet owners simply cannot afford to keep taking care of their pets. Research from the ASPCA conducted in June 2022 found that 21% of dog owners and 25% of cat owners relinquished their pets for reasons of expense.
    </p>
    <p>
        With San Francisco’s cost of living being so high, the same holds true for a pet’s cost of living. Raising a dog in San Francisco is notably more expensive compared to the national average. 
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, San Francisco dog owners spend an average of $881 annually on veterinary costs, significantly higher than the national average of $200 to $500 per year, as reported in two 2024 USA TODAY articles (https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/pet-insurance/best-cities-for-dogs/; https://www.usatoday.com/money/blueprint/pet-insurance/how-much-does-a-dog-cost-per-year/)
    </p>
    <p>
        “Veterinary fees are outrageous,” Goldberg said. “It's more expensive on a minute-by-minute basis to go to a lot of vets than pediatricians. It's just crazy.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Dog owner Sarai Sanchez estimates the total cost of caring for her dog, Miss Pink Luna, to be $2,000-3,000 a month. Though on the more expensive end, she is able to afford spoiling her dog because she does not have to worry about housing while living with her parents, Sanchez.  	
    </p>
    <p>
        However, aside from the high cost of dog ownership in San Francisco, that majority of these euthanizations results from the lack of spaying and neutering that occurred during the pandemic, Deb Campbell of SF ACC said. 
    </p>
    <p>
        When resources were redirected to human causes and COVID-19, it was more difficult to find veterinary care, Campbell said. 
    </p>
    <p>
        According to a study from the University of Florida, U.S. veterinarians performed 2.7 million fewer spay and neuter surgeries in 2020 and 2021, a 13% decrease.
    </p>
    <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/16846399"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>    <p>
        “There are a lot of dogs and cats out there that didn't get spayed or neutered that probably are still reproducing,” Campbell said. “It's frustrating for all the shelters in this country. I can't think of any shelter that's not affected by this.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Currently, shelters like SF ACC regularly face ten or more dogs being brought to their facilities each day. The No. 1 most effective way to reduce the number of unwanted dogs in shelters is through spaying and neutering, Campbell said. 
    </p>
    <p>
        “It takes a village and it takes a lot of money to try to solve problems like this, and I don't think it's going to be solved soon,” she said. “But if at least people are aware of it, baby steps but it helps — every little bit helps.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, many unhoused dogs continue to enter the system. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In response to this nationwide problem, San Francisco looks to some unique organizations that help dogs, who otherwise would be euthanized, find homes. One such organization is Muttville, a shelter that strives to find elderly dogs a loving home. Within the past year, this dog sanctuary located in the Mission district rescued more than 1,200 dogs, Public Relations Specialist Patty Stanton said.
    </p>
    <p>
        Muttville was founded by former hairstylist Sherri Franklin in 2007 and specializes in caring for and rehoming senior dogs. For dogs to be accepted to the shelter, they must be more than seven years old and good with both dogs and people, Stanton said.
    </p>
    <p>
        Muttville takes in TKTKT senior dogs from all over Northern California on an application basis. “We take 2 from, 2 from, … quote here.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Stanton said the main mission of Muttville is to make senior dogs attractive for people to adopt.
    </p>
    <p>
        “Even though they don't last as long, saving a life is just worth it, and if we don't do it, who will?” she said. “But we do find that there's lots of people in the Bay Area that have a heart to take a dog that maybe has a short time.”
    </p>
    <p>
        And that rings true for the majority of people we talked to.
